# Introduction
Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

* Make sure that node is install on your system. If not you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
* Clone this repository to your shell script terminal and you are ready to play.
* On the start of the game you will be asked to choose a game mode amongst two.
* First mode is single player (**You vs Computer**) and the second mode is double player(**You vs your friend**).
* Then you will be asked to enter your name and choose your preferred symbol in both game modes.
* Computer for now is only choosing random blocks so it will be very easy for you to defeat it.

Have fun!! :octocat:
