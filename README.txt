                                         TIC-TAC-TOE

A very simple yet popular game. This game is played between two players.
On the start of the game you will be asked to choose a game mode amongst two.
First mode is single player(You vs Computer) and the second mode is double player(You vs your friend).
Then you will be asked to enter your name and choose your preferred symbol in both game modes.
Computer for now is only choosing random blocks so it is very easy to defeat it.

Have fun!!
